**WhatsApp Mobile App** Usability Issues  
* "Add Attachment" button can be easily tapped by mistake when User intends to place cursor to the end of the line in text input field.  
    Solved in **Telegram**: as soon as User starts to type text message, "Add Attachment" button disappears. The button is available only unless User start to type text.


**WhatsApp Web App** Usability Issues  
* There is no way to run several instances of the web-app. Each time User switches between PCs, she needs to select "Use Here".  
    Why does it matter – you may ask – if User still can not look at two screens at the same time. Well, it is. The problem is that sometime it is useful to see in your browser window just the tab of an active web-app to be able to notice the number of unread messages. As long as WhatsApp Web is active, browser's tab shows something like "(1) WhatsApp", where the number in parenthesis represents the number of unread messages. Therefore, as soon as User activates WhatsApp in different tab (on different PC) and then goes back to the initial PC she worked on, she needs to explicitly activate the WhatsApp again to be able to see the presence of unread messages.

* It's impossible to correct certain message after it has been sent

> 'Phone connection issues
Your session on WhatsApp Web is an extension of WhatsApp on your phone. WhatsApp Web connects to your phone to sync messages, thus you can see all messages on both devices. The first requirement to being able to use WhatsApp Web is an active WhatsApp account on your smartphone.'
