# 2-dimensional-interaction-elements on Mobile Web Page Usability Problem

Being involved in developing mobile application for banks, I have a particular interest in watching users operating their mobile devices while accessing applications related to finance management: banks, purchasing managers, digital cards wallets and so on. That is why when I visited Artemi Lebedev Studio portfolio website yet another time, the thing that caught my eye was the mobile website of Bank Saint Petersburg.  
Here is the link: https://www.bspb.ru/webmobile/

Looking at few promo pictures of that web-site I noticed there is a quite interesting custom-looking widget for choosing a credit program that meets your personal needs the best. Here is the picture I am talking about:

<p style="font-size: 8pt">Copyright © Art. Lebedev Studio. Original link: http://img.artlebedev.ru/bspb/mobile/bspb-mobile-phone-credits.jpg</p>

It looks very nice, doesn't it? Beautiful, bright, appealing...  
**?:** Do you want to have the one like that for your own mobile-banking experience?  
Well, probably, not. Why? 

Because it **interferes with page scrolling**. It is a very **annoying usability problem**, since page scroll on the mobile phone is the first way users interact with the page in... well, high percentage of cases. There are times when the scroll is left to be the only way users interact with your web page. So, be careful not to put any widgets that may need 2-dimensional scrolling, dragging, anything. A circle widget as you see is one of that kind of widgets.

Please, be careful and **keep mobile experience simple**, especially – mobile web experience. Please, **do it for the people you love** (most of the time) like your grannies, mother, children and all others.

P. S.  
One of the first books on Design for digital, as well as for paper media, I've read was "Kovodstvo" written by Artemi Lebedev. He seems to be a well-known designer from Russia. A lot of water has flowed since then. One the most important things I've learned about design, science, art and life is basically the same things that is written on the coat of arms of Royal Society: "Take nobody's word for it". Though remembering the impression that the book made on me, I still take a look at the portfolio of Artemi Lebedev Design Studio from time to time.
